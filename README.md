# Unused Gear

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opussf/UnusedGear.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opussf/UnusedGear)

This addon moves gear to a specified bag (defaults to backpack), based on if the gear is in an equipment set.

## Description

The idea of this addon is to find equipment items in your bags that are not being used, and help you find old or unused items to discard / scrap / mail to others.


Theaddon will move gear to your backpack that is not currently being used.  "Being used" includes items in gear sets defined in the equipment manager.


Items moved too many times will be ignored.  Bags that are ignored (cleanup: Ignore this bag) will not be searched for items to move.


## Idea:
I'm always trying to figure out the gear I can 'safely' sell.
Am I still using it, is it in a gear set?

This will move items to a bag based on if it is currently being used.

## Extras

Equipment items will be ignored if not removed from your bags after a time.
Equipible items for things like professions (think skinning knife, mining axe, blacksmith hammer, etc.), will be soon not be moved.
