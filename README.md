# Unused Gear

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opussf/UnusedGear.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opussf/UnusedGear)

This addon moves gear to a specified bag (defaults to backpack), based on useability of that gear.
If the gear class (cloth, leather, mail, plate) is red, or the gear type (sword, polearm, etc.) is red.

## Idea:
I'm always trying to figure out the gear I can 'safely' sell.
Am I still using it, is it in a gear set?

This will move items to a bag (or even an end of a bag) based on usable status.
