# Unused Gear

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opussf/UnusedGear.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opussf/UnusedGear)

This addon moves gear to a specified bag (defaults to backpack), based on if the gear is in an equipment set.

## Idea:
I'm always trying to figure out the gear I can 'safely' sell.
Am I still using it, is it in a gear set?

This will move items to a bag based on if it is currently being used.

## Extras

Equipment items will be ignored if not removed from your bags after a time.
Equipible items for things like professions (think skinning knife, mining axe, blacksmith hammer, etc.), will be soon not be moved.
